# Node.js REST API Deployment on AWS EC2 with GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline Notes

This repository demonstrates a streamlined approach to deploying a Node.js REST API on an AWS EC2 instance using GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).

## Overview

In this project, we utilize GitHub Actions workflows to automate the CI/CD pipeline for deploying changes to our Node.js application on an EC2 instance. The workflow consists of:

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically building and testing the application on each push to the `main` branch.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Automatically deploying changes to the EC2 instance upon successful completion of CI.
